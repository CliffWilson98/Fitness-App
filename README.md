## Creating a Workout
The Create Workout screen allows the user to create their own custom workouts. A workout is composed of at least one exercise with a defined weight, number of reps, and sets. Exercises can be added to the workout with the "Add Exercise" button and removed by pressing the "X" to the left of their name. Once you have at least one exercise added to the workout the workout can be given a name and created.
