Exercises can be added to the workout with the "Add Exercise" button and removed by pressing the "X" to the left of their name. Once you have at least one exercise added to the workout the workout can be given a name and created.

 ## Performing a Workout 
 The perform workout screen allows the user to keep track of their reps, sets, and time while performing a workout and features buttons for manual rests if the user wishes to keep track of their time spent resting during the workout. The Perform Workout screen displays the name of the workout along with information regarding the current exercise that the user is on. The blue counter button in the middle of the screen should be pressed after the completion of each set. Upon completion of an exercise within the workout the app will automatically present the user with the next exercise to perform. At any point the user can skip an exercise or cancel the workout completely.
